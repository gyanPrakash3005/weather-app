# ☀️ WeatherApp: Your Personal Weather Guru ️

This sleek and informative weather app, built with the powerful Angular CLI (version 18.2.5), lets you stay ahead of the elements!

## Get Ready for Sun or Rain (or Snow!)

**1. Launch the Development Server:**

Fire up `ng serve` in your terminal, and you'll be greeted by the app at `http://localhost:4200/`. Any changes you make to the code will automatically refresh, making development a breeze.

**2. Build Your Weather Empire:**

Need a new component, directive, service, or something else? `ng generate` is your command. Just type `ng generate component my-weather-card` (or your preferred name) to add fresh functionality.

**3. Craft a Weatherproof Build:**

Ready to share your masterpiece with the world? Run `ng build` to create production-ready files stored in the `dist/` directory.

**4. Put Your Forecasts to the Test:**

* **Unit Tests:** Unleash `ng test` to unleash a swarm of unit tests powered by Karma, ensuring your app functions flawlessly at a granular level.
* **End-to-End Tests:** Go beyond the basics with `ng e2e`. Choose your preferred end-to-end testing platform and simulate real-world user interactions to guarantee a seamless user experience.
